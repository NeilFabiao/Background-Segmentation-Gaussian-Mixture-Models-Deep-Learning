# Background Segmentation Gaussian Mixture Models and U-Net #

The Mixture of Gaussian’s or mostly mentioned as Gaussian mixture models is a probabilistic statistical technique that can be used for image segmentation. Implementations and improvements of this approach can be seen on the paper by [4] and [5].


### Visualization of Steps ###

![alt-text-1](/Project_GMM2020/im/gmm.gif) 

### Repo structure ###

This project was done using python (jupyter-notebook), and in the Project_GMM2020 folder there are 2 other subsequent folders and files namely:

* im - is the folder that has the visualization gif and other images, used in the repo and jupyter notebook.
* dataset - folder with information provided to the students to carry out the experiments.
* report - evidence of written work. 
* ComputerVisionGmmComplete2020FinSubmit.ipynb - the file containing partial code explained in the report mentioned.

To run the implementations located in src simply select the 'ComputerVisionGmmComplete2020FinSubmit.ipynb' file. 

**Note:** 

`1. This jupyter notebook is considered part 1 of the project, containing code and explanation for the Gauissian Mixture modeling section.`

`2. After each numbered header for example 1.Dataset there will be a dedicated cell with code for the particular task .`

`3. This notebook takes aproximately 1-3 days to run on all the gmms necessary to infer since it works using the CPU.`

`4. Will include the code for the GMM section on Github some time later in the year 👍🏾`
